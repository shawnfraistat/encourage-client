README


Description:

This app shares advice and encouragement with users, based upon their interest
areas and preferences. The advice/encouragement is authored by other users and
stored on the API. The app also features sentiment analysis, changing the back-
ground color depending on the words used in each piece of advice.

Process:

I began by considering the assignment requirements. Then I began planning my
initial wireframes and data structures. I started by getting my Rails server up
and running, setting up my resources on the back end. Then I started working on
the front end. I got basic HTML/CSS in place and hooked up the front end and
back end via Javascript. Once I finished a minimal viable product, I went back
and added features. Then I polished up styles and refactored code.

Project initial user stories:

As a user, I want to be able to click on a button and see a piece of
advice/encouragement.

As a user, I want to be able to submit pieces of advice/encouragement that can
be seen by other users.

As a user, I want to be able to filter what kinds of advice/encouragement I see
so that they're relevant to my interests.

As a user, I want to be able to upvote pieces of advice I like.

As a user, I want to be able to keep a list of "favorites" I can review.



Technologies Used:

This project makes use of HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, AJAX, Ruby, and Ruby
on Rails.


Unsolved Problems:

I'd like to add more event handlers for failures. I'd also like to adjust the
CSS so that it handles different display sizes better. It would be good to also
add some animations to smooth out transitions
